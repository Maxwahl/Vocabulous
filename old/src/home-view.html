      <p>Vocabulous is a software that can be used to practice English vocabulary.
        The software offers you several options for practicing units so that you can prepare ideally for the next test. 
        You can also create your own units or add units of friends to learn the vocabulary you really need. 
        Vocabulous also gives you the ability to evaluate results of your sessions by displaying them in charts. 
        To further increase the user-friendliness, you will be able to design the software with your own colors, making it easy to create your own themes.
        This software was created using Polymer, Javascript and a Java EE server as backend.</p>

        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> is open-source JavaScript library for building web applications using Web Components. 
        The library is developed by Google developers and contributors on GitHub. Modern design principles are implemented as 
        a separate project using Google's Material Design design principles. Polymer is used by Google Services and websites, 
        including the redesigned YouTube, YouTube Gaming, the redesigned Google Earth, Google I / O websites, Google Play Music, 
        Redesign of Google Sites and Allo for web.

        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. 
        It is a language which is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. 
        The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine 
        to execute it.

        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition">Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE), formerly Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), 
        currently Jakarta EE</a>, is a set of specifications, extending Java SE with specifications for enterprise 
        features as distributed computing and web services. Java EE applications are run on reference, 
        that can be microservices or application servers, which handles transactions, security, scalability, 
        concurrency and management of the components it is deploying.
        Java EE is defined by its specification. 
        The specification defines APIs and their interactions. Java EE compliant. Java compliant.</p>
